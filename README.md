The Matlab code of the PM-TW algorithm and its randomized versions, given in the paper: "Pair-Mode Tensor Wheel Decomposition with Randomized Block Krylov Iteration" (submitted)
Please run "Main_Test.m" to recover some experiments on synthetic data. 
The main PM-TW algorithm is included in the TW_rand() function: 
Inputs: W - N-way input array, opts - structure of input parameters; 
Output: G - ring tensors, C- core tensor, Out - structure of outpout parameters
